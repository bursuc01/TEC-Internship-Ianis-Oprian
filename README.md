## View application: Tec-Internship 2024

### 1.1 Feaures:
A user can create/update/delete and get every of the following models that are defined in the database:
 - User model
 - Person model
 - Person Detail model
 - Department model
 - Salary model

The models above are displayed in the views, each one inside a tables with their specific fields, that have buttons calling the web api for the CRUD operations.

For authentication, I implemented a view that will log in a user, that has two roles:
 - Admin
 - Basic user

An admin account can be created, but not deleted (this should mimic passing forward the account, or deleting it directly from the database). The admin is the only role that can perform operations on users. If the admin is logged in, there is a view in Home View that contains a table of Users. The admin can perform CRUD operations on the users, which need to be assigned to a Person. The relation between Users and Person is one to one, so that keeping track of the employees is easier, with one account per employee.

The authentication uses a bearer token that is generated by the server and used for all the api calls. The token is stored in the session storage, and retrieved when a call is made. If no token is present when calling endpoints, the 401 Unauthorized code will be returned.

### 1.2 Additional features:

Here is a list of what additional features, beyond the requirements:
  - A user is not able to type any of the views URLs before logginh in, this will result in redircting the user back to login
  - A user cannot see or interact with the user table if his/her role is not Admin
  - A back button has been implemented
  - The login credentials are encrypted during the login, and decrypted with a hidden key on the server side. This makes the application safer against attacks. The encryption key can be found in **appsettings.json**
  - Implemented 3 layered architecture on backend. It brings: 
   	1. Maintainability: easier to update. 
	2. Scalability: each layer can be scaled independently.
	3. Reusability: services can be used by different controllers.
  - When deleting a salary, the group with that salary get a temporary salary, that can be changed with an update
  - When deleting a Department, every Position is transfered to another one, and can be changed to a new department with an update
